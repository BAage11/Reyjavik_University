# Content
This is an introductory course in programming with Python. <br>
Basic modules in programming are discussed, e.g. variables, tags, steering commands and functions. <br>
Emphasis is also placed on built-in data frames such as strings, lists and look-up tables. <br>
The concept of class is introduced and how it supports encapsulation and information concealment in object-oriented programming. <br>
Students learn to use both an integrated development environment (IDE) and a command mode to develop and run applications. 

# Learning outcome
## Knowledge
- Analyze and explain the functionality of simple applications that use the following basic units: 
  - variables
  - tags
  - expressions and valued things
  - simple input / output
  - control commands
  - collections 
  - functions
- Analyze and explain the functionality of simple applications that use clusters
- Describe what is meant by the terms encapsulation, information hiding and cognitive data and <br>
how clusters support the above identified concepts
- Understand the difference between a statement and an implementation
- Discuss the importance of an algorithm in solving problems and how problems can be solved with different algorithms

## Skills
- Use Command Line and Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to develop and run applications
- Design, implement, test, debug and modify application that uses the following basic programming elements: 
  - parameters
  - tags
  - expressions and values
  - simple input / output
  - conditionals
  - loops
  - collections
  - functions
- Select the appropriate prerequisites and loops for a specific task
- Apply subliminal design to break applications into smaller units
- Design, implement, test, debug and modify applications that use clusters
- Be able to create algorithms to solve simple problems

# Competence
- Design and develope programs for problems that are described in a general way
