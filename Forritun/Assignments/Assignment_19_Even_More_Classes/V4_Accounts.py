# In this assignment you will help a new bank get up and running. The Bank is called Happy Bank and it has two kinds of accounts, a savings account and a debit account. You will need to use inheritance in this assignment so you will need to figure out what the account types have in common and what they donÂ´t. The accounts should have a method called update_balance() which updates the balance.
# A savings account updates the balance as follows:
# It updates the balance by its interest rate and adds a bonus rate to it. For a savings account the interest rate is 5% and the bonus rate is 10%.
# A debet account updates the balance as follows:
# It updates the balance by its interest rate which is 2 % for debet accounts.
# HINT: think about using class variables for the constants (interest rate and bonus rate).
# You also need to implement the __str__() method. Think about where you should implement it. You only need to implement it once. Look at the output example here below to figure out what string the method should return.
# You also need to implement the functions print_accounts() which should print each account and update_accounts() which should call the method update_balance() on each account.
