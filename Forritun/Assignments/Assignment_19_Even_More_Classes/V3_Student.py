# Write the class "Student". The class has the attributes student_id which is an integer and a list of 4 grades. The class has the following methods:
# A constructor that takes two parameters: the studentâ€˜s ID (an integer), the student's grades (as a list of strings). The constructor uses the parameters to initializes the attributes and convert the grades to a list of floats.
# You need to implement functionality so that a Student instance can be printed using the print() function. When printed the Student shoud be printed as follows:
#                Student ID: 173
#                Grades: [5.37, 4.65, 9.85, 10.00]
# you should override the < operator which checks whether an instance of the class is less than another instance of the class. The comparison is made using the average grade of the instances.
