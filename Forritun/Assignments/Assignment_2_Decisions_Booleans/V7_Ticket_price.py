# Kingâ€™s Island needs a program for its admission booths. When visitors to the park come up to the booth to purchase their tickets, the worker uses this program to figure out how much to charge them.
 
# Each ticket cost $30. Senior citizens (age >= 65) are given a 50% discount. Children under (or equal to) the age of 5 get a free admission.

# Write a program that prompts for the visitor's age and computes the ticket price (which should be a float).


age = int(input("Input age: ")) # Do not change this line

if age > 5 and age < 65:
    print(float(30))

elif age >= 65:
    print(float(15))

else:
    print(float(0))
