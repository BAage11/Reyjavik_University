--------------------------------------------------------------------
An assignment within the course "Þróun smáforrita" (e. Application Development) at Reykjavik University, made in December 2020.

In the assignment, we create an application which displays movies that are currently playing in cinemas (Dec 2020). We use an external API (http://api.kvikmyndir.is/) to get information related to cinemas and their movies.

The video is showing the use of the final product made by the three group members - Benjamín Aage Birgisson, Davíð Bjarni Björnsson, Haukur Breki Hilmarsson..
