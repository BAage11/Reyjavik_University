General information:
App development, where the assignment was to develop an application that displays movies that are currently playing in Icelandic cinemas as well as upcoming releases.
In the assignment was used an external API to get information related to cinemas and their movies.

We implemented all the requirements within the assignment, both standard and extras.
We also added the following features to the application:
_ Order upcoming released movies in alphabetic order (ascending) (release date ordering is on by default but then the user can choose)
_ Movies currently playing ordered in alphabetical order (ascending)
_ User profile, where you can add an image and a username to your profile
_ Add movies to your personal watchlist \* Add a movie you have watched to your favourites
\_ Add a personal rating to the movies within your favourites list so you can see which movies you ranked the highest.

How to run the project: - Must have Node.js downloaded on your computer
Inside the projects directory in the terminal run "npm install"
To start up the project run either "expo start" or "npm start"

We recommend using an iPhone 12Pro for the best look and feel, but other phones/simulators work as well.
