General information:
App development, where the assignment was to develop a contacts application to replace the normal contact app on a phone.

We implemented all the requirements within the assignment, both standard and extras.
We also added the following features to the application:
_ A custom color picker to customize each contact to the users liking
Can be customized both when creating a contact and also when editing the contact
_ Detailed validation when creating / editing with custom error messages

How to run the project: - Must have Node.js downloaded on your computer
inside the projects directory in the terminal run "npm install"
to start up the project run either "expo start" or "npm start"

We recommend using an iPhone 12Pro for the best look and feel, but other phones/simulators work well also
