General information:
App development, where the assignment was to develop an application as a project management tool named 'Toddler'.
In this assignment, there was no external database used (or web service). Instead, all data is resided in memory - so every time a user shuts down the application, all the data will be wiped out clean as well (except the pre-populated data which is loaded into memory every time the application is started).

Tools used:
React Native, Redux, ES6, Expo, and other development environments
for developing apps and publishing such application(s).

How to run the system: - Must have Node.js downloaded on your computer

    - Install locally (via terminal) the following commands:
        npm install
        npm install react-native-elements
        expo install react-native-modal

    - Then, the app is started up with either of these commands:
        npm start
        or
        expo start

It may be that you need to download extra packages, but the terminal will tell you which ones (in most cases).
Examples of possible packages:

    react-navigation
    react-navigation-stack
    react-native
    react-native-modal

    expo-file-system
    expo-image-picker
    react-navigation
    expo-permissions
    expo-status-bar

    @expo/vector-icons
