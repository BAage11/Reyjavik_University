# Content
This course discusses various data structures, like linked lists, stacks, queues, trees and hash tables. 
<br>Recursive programming and sorting algorithms are also discussed. 
<br>At the same time, emphasis is put on abstract data types, object-oriented programming, templates, and exception handling.

- Be able to describe and understand the meaning of complexity/growth function algorithms.
- Be able to write programs that use each of the following data structures: arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and hash tables.
- Be able to implement various types of data structure by using linked list.
- Be able to implement simple recursive functions.
- Be able to design, implement, test and debug a program in object-oriented programming language.
- Be able to write a program that uses inheritance and polymorphism to solve a specific problem.
- Be able to write programs that responds to exceptions raised during execution.
- Be able to apply sequential search, binary search and ranking algorithm under various circumstances.
- Be able to use abstract data types by having access to their declaration only.
- Be able to design and develop programs for the programs described in general terms.
