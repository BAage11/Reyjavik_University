Multicast is  a protocol designed to allow the same data to be broadcast between 
computers on the same multicast group. Each time a host in the group sends a 
datagram to the multicast group, the network routers ensure that that datagram 
is sent to all members of the group. 

Considering the SEQ/ACK methods used by TCP/IP to guarantee reliable 
delivery of data between nodes, what fundamental issues will be created when 
trying to implement reliable multicast to large groups of hosts?

------------------------------------------------------
Excessive traffic.By using TCP/IP when dealing with multicast, 
you are consequently crashing the network very very quickly, 
as TCP/IP sends packets and waits for acknowledgement from the client(s) 
before sending the next packet. If an error occurs, 
that is a packet has not been received by the client, 
a sequence of error handling is then processed - meaning packets 
are being sent again over the network, which does not lead to an 
ideal multicast to large groups of hosts.
