TCP/IP deliveres/receives an ordered and error-checked stream of information packets over a network.
UDP, however, delivers a faster stream of information by excluding error-checking.

With this in mind, I would prefer to design a real time audio application with UDP, as the main purpose is to deliver soundbites to the user.
With minor errors occuring with the sound quality, it will not interfere with the usage of the application for the end-user, but provide
him/her with fast stream of audio instead - therefore providing the user with the main purpose of the application, real time audio.

Pros: No excessive latency, which would slow the application down, resulting in faster communcation between the devices.

Cons: Data (packets) can be lost with UDP, versus not lost with TCP
