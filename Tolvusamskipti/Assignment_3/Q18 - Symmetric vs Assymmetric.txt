Explain the differences between symmetric and asymmetric encryption.

Symmetric encryption:  Same key is used to encrypt and decrypt.
Plaintext --> Encryption (key) --> Ciphertext --> Decryption (key) --> Plaintext


Asymmetric encryption:  Two different keys, one to encrypt, and to decrypt.
Plaintext --> Encryption (key1) --> Ciphertext --> Decryption (key2) --> Plaintext
