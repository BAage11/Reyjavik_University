Goodput is the useful user traffic transmitted by a network. 
That is, packets sent per second (packets/sec). 

In a congestion collapse, network becomes unusable, 
as transmission of dropped packets increases load, 
which causes more packets to be dropped. 

Therefore, resulting in a goodput collapse, 
as the network is still carrying its full load of traffic, 
but has been driven out by error recovery traffic. 

This may in the end result in the network crashing, as you shall not do.
