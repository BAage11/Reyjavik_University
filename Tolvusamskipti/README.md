# Content
The course begins with a brief overview of networks and online services. <br>
<br>
The main emphasis is on the layering of the OSI / IETF models where the following network layers will be examined in detail:<br>
- Application layer - WWW, HTTP, DNS, SMTP, FTP etc. 
- Transport layer - UDP and TCP. 
- Network layer - network traffic management (e. routing), IP and IP addresses. 
- Link layer - MAC, Ethernet and LAN, hubs and switches. 
<br>
Finally, there will be an introduction to more specific topics, such as mobile networks and network security. <br>
Students get to know the topics through programming assignments and homework.
