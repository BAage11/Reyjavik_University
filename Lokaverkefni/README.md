# Content
The Final Project consists of software development in collaboration with a customer and users outside the university. <br>
<br>
The purpose of the final project is to give students experience of working independently on specification, <br>
design and implementation of software and to use accepted methods in the development cycle. <br>
<br>
Normally 2 to 4 students work together in a project group. While working on the project, students gain practical <br>
experience of analysis, design, programming and testing. <br>
<br>
The projects are evaluated by the project supervisor and two other internal examiners. <br>
The grade is based on evaluation at various stages of development and takes into account all aspects of the development work. <br>
The projects conclude with a public presentation.
