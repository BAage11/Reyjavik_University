# Content
This course introduces the most important types of algorithms and databases in use today. <br>
There is a special emphasis placed on algorithm for ranking, search and network. <br>
The subject is to develop implementations, analyze or measure their effectiveness, and evaluate how well they could be used in real-world challenges.
